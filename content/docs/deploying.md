# Deploying

Gridsome generates static files when the `gridsome build` command runs. By default it generates output in the `dist` directory.
Since these are simple HTML and JS files, you only need a server which hosts these files.

For more information on deploying, check out the [Gridsome Docs](https://gridsome.org/docs/deploy-to-netlify/).
